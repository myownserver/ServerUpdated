## Requirements

+ A working brain
+ Knowledge of basic python
+ A working Tata Sky/ Play account
+ Channels that you want to watch, already subscribed **(I'm sorry, no freebies)**
+ An app capable of reading a [m3u](https://docs.fileformat.com/audio/m3u/) file

## How to use
I know you would love to get your hands on how this works, but hold on and read before you proceed further
 > The methods are divided into `Easy` and `Difficult` based on how comfortable you are with the commandline. The `Easy` guide is recommended if you have no working knowledge of Python or scripting in general
## The Easy Way (Using an App)

- Login with your SID, RMN and OTP/ Password(deprecated) first
- Once you login, your details are saved to your local storage so that you don't have to enter the details again and again
- Every 24 hours, the playlist expires, so the app gives you the next expiry time and you will have to generate your playlist again before that time
- The app can be found in the [releases page](https://github.com/ForceGT/Tata-Sky-IPTV/releases)
```
Minimum Supported  Android Version : Android 5.0
```

## The Difficult Way (Using a Script)
### Setting up your environment

+ Make sure you have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) up and running on your system. **If you don't know how to do this then well, don't think of proceeding further**
+ You need `requests` to be installed. Do that by using ``pip install requests``

### Running the scripts
+ Clone this to your directory using ```git clone https://github.com/ForceGT/TSPrivateAPI``` or download the `zip` file and then go inside the `code_samples` directory and open your terminal there
+ Change to the ```code_samples``` directory by using  ```cd code_samples```
+ Simply run ```main.py``` (the main script) using the following code
```python
    python main.py
```
+ You will get options to login using the different methods, upon successful login a ```userDetails.json``` file is created which contains important details of the user. The ```accessToken``` has to be updated from time to time. To do so run the login logic again. If you delete the ```userDetails.json``` file you will have to login again so please be careful 

+ You can generate m3u file by selecting option 3. This generates ```allChannelPlaylist.m3u``` file in the current directory.**NOTE: Please run this only after logging in using Step 1 or 2 otherwise the script exits with an error**

+ You need to login just once usually, it will create a `userDetails.json` file once you login, and then you can just regenerate the playlist each day when you would like to use it. If you don't see the `userDetails.json` file anywhere, then you may have to login again
